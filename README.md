# PyTorch_Img_Segmentation
Project completed during my course certification for Deep Learning with PyTorch: Image Segmentation. Supervised machine learning through binary classification.
Created in CoLab.

To set up the GPU runtime environment, the following are required:

!pip install segmentation-models-pytorch
!pip install -U git+https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations
!pip install --upgrade opencv-contrib-python

To download the dataset:

!git clone https://github.com/parth1620/Human-Segmentation-Dataset-master.git
